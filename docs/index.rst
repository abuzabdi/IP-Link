The goal of IP-Link is to show the relationships between different IP addresses
from network traffic capture, thus quickly determining for a given address the
IP address with which it communicates the most.

You can clone the source code of IP-Link :

.. code-block:: bash

    $ hg clone https://bitbucket.org/cedricbonhomme/ip-link/
