The goal of `IP-Link <https://bitbucket.org/cedricbonhomme/ip-link>`_ is to show the
relationships between different IP addresses from network traffic capture, thus
quickly determining for a given address the IP address with which it communicates the most.

You can clone the source code of IP-Link :

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git clone https://bitbucket.org/cedricbonhomme/ip-link.git
